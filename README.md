# Space Leviathan

The game is a 2D pixel art side-scrolling space adventure where players control a massive space whale that consumes
celestial debris and stars to fuel its power bar, which depletes when using abilities: Dash for quick bursts of speed,
Shield for protection, and Beam for destruction. Frequent ability use reduces energy costs, encouraging a fluid,
skill-based playstyle. Players must navigate dynamic space environments, evading or breaking large obstacles while
avoiding the pull of black holes. With no traditional upgrades, survival depends on mastery of movement and energy
management as the cosmos grows increasingly chaotic.

## Draft

### Core Mechanics Enhancements
- **Momentum-Based Movement**: The whale moves with a slight sense of inertia, making precise control and energy management crucial. This would give a sense of weight and fluidity to the whale’s movement.
- **Energy Efficiency Scaling**: As abilities are used more often, they become more energy-efficient, encouraging a risk-reward loop where aggressive players are rewarded for mastery over time.
- **Star Consumption Variants**: Different types of celestial bodies provide unique benefits—small stars restore energy quickly, neutron stars provide temporary ability boosts, and rare pulsars give a short burst of near-invincibility.

### Environmental Interactions
- **Gravity Wells**: Planets and black holes exert gravitational pull, subtly affecting movement. Players must use dashes and momentum strategically to escape or slingshot around obstacles.
- **Collapsing Stars & Supernovae**: Some stars, when left alone too long, can explode into supernovae, damaging everything in their radius but also creating powerful waves of energy that can be absorbed.
- **Cosmic Currents**: Areas in space with faster-moving stellar winds can either propel or slow the whale down, creating opportunities for skilled movement.

### Dynamic Challenge Elements
- **Space Predators**: Ethereal space creatures—such as cosmic eels or star-consuming void serpents—occasionally appear, hunting the whale and forcing strategic retreats or combat using the beam ability.
- **Asteroid Swarms & Star Storms**: Random cosmic events introduce waves of environmental hazards that require quick reflexes to dodge or break through.
- **Black Hole Variants**: Instead of just being hazards, some black holes could lead to secret areas, requiring precise movement and risk-taking.

### Progression & Incentives
- **Rare Cosmic Events**: Occasionally, unique celestial phenomena—such as eclipsing binary stars or galactic rifts—appear, providing high-risk, high-reward opportunities for players to refuel energy or unlock secrets.
- **Score & Survival System**: Instead of traditional levels, the goal could be endurance-based, where players see how long they can survive against increasing cosmic dangers, with score multipliers tied to skillful play.
- **Procedural Generation**: The universe is infinite, and every playthrough generates a new arrangement of obstacles, black holes, and energy sources, ensuring no two runs are identical.
