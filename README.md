## Core Mechanics
- **Fluid Space Movement**: The player controls **Nyx**, a cosmic space whale that glides through space with smooth, wave-like motion. Precise control over ascent, descent, and dashing is crucial to navigating the terrain.
- **Auto-Scrolling Levels**: The screen moves forward automatically, requiring players to react quickly to obstacles and enemies.
- **Dodge & Dash Mechanics**: Nyx can swiftly maneuver through asteroid fields and enemy attacks with a well-timed dash move.
- **Obstacle Navigation**: Various hazards, such as floating asteroids, black holes, and unstable wormholes, require precise movement and quick decision-making.
- **Enemy Encounters**: Hostile alien creatures, like **Void Eels**, **Nebula Jellies**, and **Hunter Drones**, actively seek to hinder Nyx‚Äôs progress.
- **Power-Up System**: Nyx can consume **luminous stars** to gain temporary buffs, including shields, speed boosts, and phase-shifting abilities.

## Environmental Interactions
- **Gravity Pockets**: Areas with fluctuating gravity alter Nyx‚Äôs movement speed and trajectory, requiring adaptive navigation.
- **Nebula Currents**: Cosmic clouds create natural movement currents that push Nyx forward, sometimes helping and sometimes hindering.
- **Pulsars & Solar Flares**: Pulsars emit timed shockwaves that disrupt movement, while solar flares can momentarily blind the player‚Äôs vision.
- **Destructible Space Debris**: Some obstacles can be broken apart using Nyx‚Äôs dash, sometimes revealing hidden dangers or power-ups.
- **Wormhole Shortcuts**: Hidden wormholes serve as high-risk, high-reward paths that can lead to secret zones or level skips.

## Dynamic Challenge Elements
- **Adaptive Enemy AI**: Enemies react to Nyx‚Äôs movement patterns, forcing players to vary their tactics.
- **Destructible & Collapsing Environments**: Certain asteroid fields and debris structures can shift dynamically, changing the layout of the level in real-time.
- **Time-Limited Power-Ups**: Consumed stars provide buffs with a set duration, requiring strategic use to maximize effectiveness.
- **Survival Sections**: Some levels introduce high-pressure escape sequences, such as evading an incoming cosmic storm, a planet‚Äôs gravitational pull, or a mothership‚Äôs tractor beam.

## Progression & Incentives
- **Experience-Based Upgrades**: Nyx gains experience by surviving encounters and consuming stars, unlocking new abilities like enhanced dashes, sonar detection, or temporary cloaking.
- **Cosmetic Customization**: Players can collect rare cosmic artifacts to modify Nyx‚Äôs appearance with unique visual effects, such as nebula patterns or glowing energy trails.
- **Exploration Rewards**: Secret pathways and hidden celestial beings provide additional lore, collectibles, and gameplay advantages.
- **Challenge & Leaderboard Modes**: Includes **Survival Mode** (endless asteroid belt challenge), **Time Trial Mode** (speed-focused completion), and global leaderboards to track high scores and best times.
